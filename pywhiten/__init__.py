"""
pywhiten is a python package for conducting Lomb-Scargle-based pre-whitening to identify
frequencies, amplitudes, and phases of sinusoidal variability signals in time series data.

The basic methodology implemented in this frequency analysis package is based on least-squares fitting of sinusoidal
models to time series data (based on the seminal papers of N. R. Lomb (1976) and J. D. Scargle (1982). This is a
popular approach to frequency analysis within the observational astronomy community, however other approaches have seen
a significant degree of use (e.g. Phase Dispersion Minimization) as well. The approach implemented in this package has
the advantages of 1) being computationally fast, utilizing the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram and Levenberg-Marquardt
minimization routines, and 2) providing results in an easily-quantifiable form. The core functionality of this program
was written and validated by Erik William Stacey as a principle component of the analysis presented in his MSc
thesis at the Royal Military College of Canada.
