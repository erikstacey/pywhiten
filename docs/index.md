Pywhiten is a Python package which is used for conducting Lomb-Scargle based frequency analyses of time series data. It was
written by Erik Stacey for application with TESS and CoRoT photometric observations of massive stars. While principally
designed for work with massive stars, much of its functionality is generally applicable to gapped and unevenly-sampled
time series data.

A getting started guide is available [here](https://pywhiten.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started), and the full
documentation can be accessed through the navigation panel.
