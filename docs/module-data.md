# Data (Module)

The data module encapsulates several classes which are useful for storing and manipulating data for time series analysis.
Results of a frequency analysis are stored as objects of class Frequency, in a FrequencyContainer object. Lightcurve and Periodogram
classes provide the ability to store a time series and its pseudo-power spectrum.
