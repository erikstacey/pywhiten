# pywhiten

A python package for conducting Lomb-Scargle-based pre-whitening of stellar time series. A similar program, called pypw,
was written and utilized for the analyses presented in my Master's thesis. I'm in the process of converting pypw to
this package, such that it can be utilized in a more accessible fashion.

Current Status (8 Mar 2023):

Behaviour of pypw almost fully re-implemented. Need to add auto-prewhitening functionality. Documentation to follow.

Expected completion: By 24 Mar, 2023
